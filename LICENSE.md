- the original part remains BSD2P-licensed
- the new part can be licensed as its author wishes

Bearing in mind that:

- in order to be licensable, modifications must be significant enough to
  constitute “creative work”
- modifications are [automatically
  BSD2P-licensed](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#6-contributions-under-repository-license)
  if contributed to a BSD2P-licensed software repository

The inclusion of BSD2P-licensed software within a larger work does not affect
